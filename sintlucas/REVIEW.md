## First Review [02-10-2025]
#### What I showed off:
* I showed off the FDD document and 2 of my design try-outs.

#### Received feedback:
* I was told to make the FDD a bit more professional.
* Also, I was advised to go with whichever design shows off what kind of person I am.
* And since I struggle to get started on the website's design/wireframe, I was advised to not think about the style, but start with basic functionality.

#### What you will do with the feedback:
* I'm going to make a list of whatever basic elements need to fill the pages.
* Then I'm going to create an extremely simple wireframe sketches and choose whichever ones speak more to me.
* After that, I will start with building those sketches into a functional website.

#### Priorities for next sprint:
* To not focus on the design/style but rather basic functionality
* Have all the pages be created and functional, in the simplest way possible.
