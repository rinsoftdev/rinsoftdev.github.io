# Portfolio project
Unlock your creativity and craft a captivating portfolio website!

This project invites you to design and develop your own personal site to showcase your skills, experiences, achievements, and especially your projects to the world. 
Highlighting your projects is crucial, as they provide tangible evidence of your abilities and the value you can bring. You can think of:
* A project gallery
* Detailed Case Studies
* Interactive Demos 
* Code Repositories 
* Video Presentations 
* Blog Posts or Articles

Remember: Your portfolio must meet all the requirements outlined in the Functional Design Document (FDD).

## Collect proof of your work in the 'sintlucas' folder
* Any document you create (FDD.md, TDD.md, REVIEW.md and any other document)
* Screenshots of your scrum board during stand-ups (before and after).
* Video of (or parts of) the working application.
* Screenshots of tests you did and the changes you made afterwards.
* Notes created during meetings.
* ...

## General planning
A planning a scrum master could use:
[GENERAL_PLANNING.md](sintlucas%2FGENERAL_PLANNING.md)

## Analyse the FDD (Functional Design Document)
Make sure that you understand what you need to build:
* Study all available information in the Functional Design Document (FDD)
* Refine the requirements in the FDD and use diagrams (e.g. wireframes, flow charts).

## Analyse the TDD (Technical Design Document)
Read the TDD in the `sintlucas` folder.
 
## Prepare
* Create a scrum board in `GitHub Projects`.
* Place the refined requirements in `GitHub Issues`, or the backlog.
* Add just enough items to the `sprint backlog` in the scrum board's `To do` column.
  
## Realise
Each lesson:
* Open the Issues and update if necessary.
* Are there any impediments in your way and should you ask for help?
* Start developing on the items.

Don't forget:
* Commit and push your changes regularly.
* Check the result in the browser regularly.
* Make sure that your code is readable and has comments.
* Make sure that your code follows the code conventions.

## Test
* Perform tests on the application as described in the TDD.

## Review
* Show the result of each item in the `Done` column.
* Write down feedback you get in `REVIEW.md`.
* Add/change items in the backlog (in Issues) based on the feedback in `REVIEW.md`.

## Retrospective
* Complete the `RETROSPECTIVE.md` in the `sintlucas` folder.

## Presentation & Assessment
In the last week you will present the results:
  * Prepare for the presentation
  * Show the end product
  * Prove that you met the criteria in `sintlucas/ASSESSMENT.MD`
  * You will be assessed on the criteria in `sintlucas/ASSESSMENT.MD`.
  * You will receive feedback on your work.

## Video of your work
Create a video of the working application:
* Before the Presentation & Assessment, you must create a video of the working application.
* The video should show the main functionalities of the application.
* It should be a screencast with a voice-over.
* The video should be maximal 25MB in size.
* Add the video to the `sintlucas` folder.
* Give the video a clear name, e.g. `video-portfolioproject-your-name.mp4`.
