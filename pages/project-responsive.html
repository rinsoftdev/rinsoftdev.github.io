    <h3> <br/>Bit of history:</h3>
    <p>
        I'm second year into my study, and we just learned about the existence of css grid and flexbox.
        Naturally when an "ambition project" came along,
        I wanted to strengthen the newly acquired knowledge by practicing some more, <br/>and also since having my websites be responsive
        is something very important for me.
    </p>

    <h3> <br/>Styling choices and End Goal:</h3>


    <p> The plan was to create a website that is both suitable for PC mode and Phone mode, with the contents shifting to the
        viewport's needs. With header, footer, and body that consists of 2 halves.
        <br/><br/>The idea to make the website, or part of it, into a sort of "stim board" came from a new t-shirt I just got,
        which has a 3x3 grid with different images, whereas stim boards also include gifs.<br/>
        The colors were directly picked from the website's showcase of the tee's graphic.<br/>
        After I realized that the website will need to resize to a phone's viewport, I decided to cut the amount of
        gifs to just 5, but have them be different formats for more interactivity.

    </p>
    <!--bottom:learned skills, conclutions-->

    <h3> <br/>Conclutions and Learned skills:</h3>
    <p>
        The website turned out fine, it's definitely nothing special, but it does what it was supposed to
        and that's enough for me.
        <br/>It taught me more in-depth about using css grid and flexbox, the relation about parent and child elements, making code
        separately for different formats using @media in css, and making resizable fonts.
    </p>

    <p> Animated gif's below: </p>

    <div class="project-gallery" style="justify-content: center; gap: 5vh;">
        <div class="gallery-image-container">

            <img src="../images/work-page-imgs/response-img/Alec_big_dance.gif"/>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>All the 3 gifs with hovers on them were illustrated and animated by me.
    The frames for the first 2 were made in Krita, and the last was fully animated in Aseprite.</p>
