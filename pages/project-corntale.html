    <h3> Bit of history:</h3>
    <p>
        CornTale was made as a project for my software development study to show off my developer skills
        I got during the first half a year here.
        <br/><br/>
        I fumbled on one of the previous Unity 2D projects, and I needed to redeem myself. <br/>
        Since this was an abition project, it meant I could make whatever I want as long as it fits withing the study.
        And "2D game" + "whatever I want" = Undertale Fangame.
        <br/><br/>

    <h3> <br/>Styling choices and End Goal:</h3>


    <p>
        The plan was to create a simulation of a shop, with functions directly taken from the inspiration source: <br/>
        - Player can buy 4 different items, the first 2 can only be bought once. <br/>
        - Player has an inventory that fills up (only visually) <br/>
        - Player has a certain amount of starting money (G) that gets affected after purchase. <br/>
        - Player can talk to the shopkeeper on 4 different topics. <br/>
        - Player can try to sell things to the shopkeeper, but they will refuse. <br/>
        - There is an exit button that restarts the game, instead of exiting it. <br/>

    <h3> <br/>Conclusions and Learned skills:</h3>

    <p>
        Every single point from above was achieved!!
        The first reason to make this project was to get more familiar with Unity, and I can proudly say that it worked!
        <br/><br/>
        I've also improved my research skills, since I would only follow guides I'd find myself. But I did still ask for a lot
        of feedback from my friends and teachers.
        <br/>
        I am quite comfortable using Unity for things like this now. This project has also improved my C# skills and was
        a head start for me to get into the new medium -> Pixel Art.
        <br/><br/>
        For this version of the game (v1.0) I must say I had a terrible time with Unity Animator, so sometimes the game would break
        if spammed too much (that was fixed in the later update)
        <br/>
        I was creating the sprites while designing the character, so the design isn't final, and i'd like to change it
        in the future. Some extra struggles can be seen on the image below:

    <p>This image was compiled long time ago for the presentation of the game.
        On it you can see a tiny bit of progress visuals.</p>

    <br/>

<!--    <h3> <br/>Fun Fact!</h3>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        Somewhere at the early stages of development I broke my arm (and that seeped into the game ehe)-->
<!--        And half of my time for this project (2 weeks) I spent recovering in a friends' house lmao.-->
<!--        However, by that point I was on a time crunch, so much so, that I remember waking up during one of-->
<!--        my nights there just to see the world around me be pixelized. So, take your breaks, kids.-->
<!--        (I had a lot of fun tho dw)-->
